# Financial-Search-Engine

The project offers a search engine solution that sends investors to a curated list of companies for further investigation. This search engine solution is split into two sections. First, the search engine will look for companies that meet the investor's requirements and will deliver the company's financial balance sheet information. For example, if an investor wants to examine agricultural enterprises, the search engine will return agricultural corporations with relevant financial data. Second, the search engine will provide a rating to the companies based on their investment potential. Finally, it will generate a list of firms ordered from top to bottom, informing investors of a condensed selection of companies to research based on financial data. The data is crawled from Yahoo Finance.

The following models were used to find the relevant companies: 
* Boolean Model
* Vector Space
* Topic Modeling using LDA
* BM25
